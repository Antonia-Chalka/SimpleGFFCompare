Calculate basic stats from final GFFcompare output
False positive (FP) = the total number of nucleotides not present in template GFF
True positive (TP) = the total number of nucleotides present in both GFF
False negative (FN) = the total number of nucleotides not present in sample GFF

False discovery rate (FDR) = FP / (FP + TP)
Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN)
